    <title>Shishi API Reference Manual</title>

    <para>
Shishi is an implementation of the Kerberos 5 network authentication
system, as specified in RFC 4120.  Shishi can be used to authenticate
users in distributed systems.
    </para>

    <para>
Shishi contains a library ('libshishi') that can be used by
application developers to add support for Kerberos 5.  Shishi contains
a command line utility ('shishi') that is used by users to acquire and
manage tickets (and more).  The server side, a Key Distribution
Center, is implemented by 'shishid'.  Of course, a manual documenting
usage aspects as well as the programming API is included.
    </para>

    <para>
Shishi currently supports AS/TGS exchanges for acquiring tickets,
pre-authentication, the AP exchange for performing client and server
authentication, and SAFE/PRIV for integrity/privacy protected
application data exchanges.
    </para>

    <para>
Shishi is internationalized; error and status messages can be
translated into the users' language; user name and passwords can be
converted into any available character set (normally including
ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8) and also be processed using an experimental
Stringprep profile.
    </para>

    <para>
Most, if not all, of the widely used encryption and checksum types are
supported, such as 3DES, AES, ARCFOUR and HMAC-SHA1.
    </para>

    <para>
Shishi is developed for the GNU/Linux system, but runs on over 20
platforms including most major Unix platforms and Windows, and many
kind of devices including iPAQ handhelds and S/390 mainframes.
    </para>

    <para>
Shishi is free software licensed under the GNU General Public License
version 3.0.
