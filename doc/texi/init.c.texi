@subheading shishi
@anchor{shishi}
@deftypefun {Shishi *} {shishi} ( @var{void})

Initializes the Shishi library, and set up, using
@code{shishi_error_set_outputtype()}, the library so that future warnings
and informational messages are printed to stderr.  If this function
fails, it may print diagnostic errors to stderr.

@strong{Return value:} Returns Shishi library handle, or @code{NULL} on error.
@end deftypefun

@subheading shishi_server
@anchor{shishi_server}
@deftypefun {Shishi *} {shishi_server} ( @var{void})

Initializes the Shishi library, and set up, using
@code{shishi_error_set_outputtype()}, the library so that future warnings
and informational messages are printed to the syslog.  If this
function fails, it may print diagnostic errors to the syslog.

@strong{Return value:} Returns Shishi library handle, or @code{NULL} on error.
@end deftypefun

@subheading shishi_done
@anchor{shishi_done}
@deftypefun {void} {shishi_done} (Shishi * @var{handle})
@var{handle}: shishi handle as allocated by @code{shishi_init()}.

Deallocates the shishi library handle.  The handle must not be used
in any calls to shishi functions after this.

If there is a default tkts, it is written to the default tkts file
(call @code{shishi_tkts_default_file_set()} to change the default tkts
file). If you do not wish to write the default tkts file, close the
default tkts with shishi_tkts_done(handle, NULL) before calling
this function.
@end deftypefun

@subheading shishi_init
@anchor{shishi_init}
@deftypefun {int} {shishi_init} (Shishi ** @var{handle})
@var{handle}: pointer to handle to be created.

Create a Shishi library handle, using @code{shishi()}, and read the system
configuration file, user configuration file and user tickets from
their default locations.  The paths to the system configuration
file is decided at compile time, and is $sysconfdir/shishi.conf.
The user configuration file is $HOME/.shishi/config, and the user
ticket file is $HOME/.shishi/ticket.

The handle is allocated regardless of return values, except for
SHISHI_HANDLE_ERROR which indicates a problem allocating the
handle.  (The other error conditions comes from reading the files.)

@strong{Return value:} Returns SHISHI_OK iff successful.
@end deftypefun

@subheading shishi_init_with_paths
@anchor{shishi_init_with_paths}
@deftypefun {int} {shishi_init_with_paths} (Shishi ** @var{handle}, const char * @var{tktsfile}, const char * @var{systemcfgfile}, const char * @var{usercfgfile})
@var{handle}: pointer to handle to be created.

@var{tktsfile}: Filename of ticket file, or NULL.

@var{systemcfgfile}: Filename of system configuration, or NULL.

@var{usercfgfile}: Filename of user configuration, or NULL.

Create a Shishi library handle, using @code{shishi()}, and read the system
configuration file, user configuration file, and user tickets from
the specified locations.  If any of @code{usercfgfile} or @code{systemcfgfile}
is NULL, the file is read from its default location, which for the
system configuration file is decided at compile time, and is
$sysconfdir/shishi.conf, and for the user configuration file is
$HOME/.shishi/config.  If the ticket file is NULL, a ticket file is
not read at all.

The handle is allocated regardless of return values, except for
SHISHI_HANDLE_ERROR which indicates a problem allocating the
handle.  (The other error conditions comes from reading the files.)

@strong{Return value:} Returns SHISHI_OK iff successful.
@end deftypefun

@subheading shishi_init_server
@anchor{shishi_init_server}
@deftypefun {int} {shishi_init_server} (Shishi ** @var{handle})
@var{handle}: pointer to handle to be created.

Create a Shishi library handle, using @code{shishi_server()}, and read the
system configuration file.  The paths to the system configuration
file is decided at compile time, and is $sysconfdir/shishi.conf.

The handle is allocated regardless of return values, except for
SHISHI_HANDLE_ERROR which indicates a problem allocating the
handle.  (The other error conditions comes from reading the file.)

@strong{Return value:} Returns SHISHI_OK iff successful.

@anchor{shishi_init_server_with_paths}
@deftypefun {int} {shishi_init_server_with_paths} (Shishi ** @var{handle}, const char * @var{systemcfgfile})
@var{handle}: pointer to handle to be created.

@var{systemcfgfile}: Filename of system configuration, or NULL.

Create a Shishi library handle, using @code{shishi_server()}, and read the
system configuration file from specified location.  The paths to
the system configuration file is decided at compile time, and is
$sysconfdir/shishi.conf.  The handle is allocated regardless of
return values, except for SHISHI_HANDLE_ERROR which indicates a
problem allocating the handle.  (The other error conditions comes
