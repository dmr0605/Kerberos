@var{handle}: shishi handle as allocated by @code{shishi_init()}.

@var{data}: constant memory buffer with keytab of @code{len} size.

@var{len}: size of memory buffer with keytab data.

@var{keys}: allocated key set to store keys in.

Read keys from a MIT keytab data structure, and add them to the key
set.

The format of keytab's is proprietary, and this function support
the 0x0501 and 0x0502 formats.  See the section The MIT Kerberos
Keytab Binary File Format in the Shishi manual for a description of
the reverse-engineered format.

@strong{Returns:} Returns @code{SHISHI_KEYTAB_ERROR} if the data does not
represent a valid keytab structure, and @code{SHISHI_OK} on success.

Read keys from a MIT keytab data structure from a file, and add the
keys to the key set.

must be deallocated by caller on succes.

Create a new key set populated with keys from a MIT keytab data
structure read from a memory block.
