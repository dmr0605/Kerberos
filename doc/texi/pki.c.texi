Guesses the default X.509 CA certificate filename; it is

@var{x509cafile}: string with new default x509 client certificate file name,
or NULL to reset to default.

Set the default X.509 CA certificate filename used in the library.
The certificate is used during TLS connections with the KDC to
authenticate the KDC.  The string is copied into the library, so
you can dispose of the variable immediately after calling this
function.
