@subheading shisa
@anchor{shisa}
@deftypefun {Shisa *} {shisa} ( @var{void})

Initializes the Shisa library.  If this function fails, it may
print diagnostic errors to stderr.

@strong{Return value:} Returns Shisa library handle, or @code{NULL} on error.
@end deftypefun

@subheading shisa_done
@anchor{shisa_done}
@deftypefun {void} {shisa_done} (Shisa * @var{dbh})
Deallocates the shisa library handle.  The handle must not be used
in any calls to shisa functions after this.
@end deftypefun

@subheading shisa_init
@anchor{shisa_init}
@deftypefun {int} {shisa_init} (Shisa ** @var{dbh})
@var{dbh}: pointer to library handle to be created.

Create a Shisa library handle, using @code{shisa()}, and read the system
configuration file from their default locations.  The paths to the
default system configuration file is decided at compile time
($sysconfdir/shisa.conf).

The handle is allocated regardless of return values, except for
SHISA_INIT_ERROR which indicates a problem allocating the handle.
(The other error conditions comes from reading the files.)

@strong{Return value:} Returns @code{SHISA_OK} iff successful.
@end deftypefun

@subheading shisa_init_with_paths
@anchor{shisa_init_with_paths}
@deftypefun {int} {shisa_init_with_paths} (Shisa ** @var{dbh}, const char * @var{file})
@var{dbh}: pointer to library handle to be created.

@var{file}: Filename of system configuration, or NULL.

Create a Shisa library handle, using @code{shisa()}, and read the system
configuration file indicated location (or the default location, if
@code{NULL}).  The paths to the default system configuration file is
decided at compile time ($sysconfdir/shisa.conf).

The handle is allocated regardless of return values, except for
SHISA_INIT_ERROR which indicates a problem allocating the handle.
(The other error conditions comes from reading the files.)

@strong{Return value:} Returns @code{SHISA_OK} iff successful.
@end deftypefun
