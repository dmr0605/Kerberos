.SH NAME
shishi_pbkdf2_sha1 \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <shishi.h>
.sp
.BI "int shishi_pbkdf2_sha1(Shishi * " handle ", const char * " P ", size_t " Plen ", const char * " S ", size_t " Slen ", unsigned int " c ", unsigned int " dkLen ", char * " DK ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "Shishi * handle" 12
shishi handle as allocated by \fBshishi_init()\fP.
.IP "const char * P" 12
input password, an octet string
.IP "size_t Plen" 12
length of password, an octet string
.IP "const char * S" 12
input salt, an octet string
.IP "size_t Slen" 12
length of salt, an octet string
.IP "unsigned int c" 12
iteration count, a positive integer
.IP "unsigned int dkLen" 12
intended length in octets of the derived key, a positive integer,
at most (2^32 \- 1) * hLen.  The DK array must have room for this many
characters.
.IP "char * DK" 12
output derived key, a dkLen\-octet string
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Derive key using the PBKDF2 defined in PKCS5.  PBKDF2 applies a
pseudorandom function to derive keys. The length of the derived key
is essentially unbounded. (However, the maximum effective search
space for the derived key may be limited by the structure of the
underlying pseudorandom function, which is this function is always
SHA1.)
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns SHISHI_OK iff successful.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug-shishi@gnu.org>.
