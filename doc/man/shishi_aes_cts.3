.SH NAME
shishi_aes_cts \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <shishi.h>
.sp
.BI "int shishi_aes_cts(Shishi * " handle ", int " decryptp ", const char * " key ", size_t " keylen ", const char " iv[16] ", char * " ivout[16] ", const char * " in ", size_t " inlen ", char ** " out ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "Shishi * handle" 12
shishi handle as allocated by \fBshishi_init()\fP.
.IP "int decryptp" 12
0 to indicate encryption, non\-0 to indicate decryption.
.IP "const char * key" 12
input character array with key to use.
.IP "size_t keylen" 12
length of input character array with key to use.
.IP "const char iv[16]" 12
.IP "char * ivout[16]" 12
.IP "const char * in" 12
input character array of data to encrypt/decrypt.
.IP "size_t inlen" 12
length of input character array of data to encrypt/decrypt.
.IP "char ** out" 12
newly allocated character array with encrypted/decrypted data.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Encrypt or decrypt data (depending on \fIdecryptp\fP) using AES in
CBC\-CTS mode.  The length of the key, \fIkeylen\fP, decide if AES 128 or
AES 256 should be used.  The \fIout\fP buffer must be deallocated by the
caller.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns SHISHI_OK iff successful.
