.SH NAME
shishi_kdcrep_set_enc_part \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <shishi.h>
.sp
.BI "int shishi_kdcrep_set_enc_part(Shishi * " handle ", Shishi_asn1 " kdcrep ", int32_t " etype ", uint32_t " kvno ", const char * " buf ", size_t " buflen ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "Shishi * handle" 12
shishi handle as allocated by \fBshishi_init()\fP.
.IP "Shishi_asn1 kdcrep" 12
KDC\-REP to add enc\-part field to.
.IP "int32_t etype" 12
encryption type used to encrypt enc\-part.
.IP "uint32_t kvno" 12
key version number.
.IP "const char * buf" 12
input array with encrypted enc\-part.
.IP "size_t buflen" 12
size of input array with encrypted enc\-part.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Set the encrypted enc\-part field in the KDC\-REP.  The encrypted
data is usually created by calling \fBshishi_encrypt()\fP on the DER
encoded enc\-part.  To save time, you may want to use
\fBshishi_kdcrep_add_enc_part()\fP instead, which calculates the
encrypted data and calls this function in one step.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns SHISHI_OK iff successful.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug-shishi@gnu.org>.
