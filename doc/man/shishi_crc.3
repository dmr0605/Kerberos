shishi_crc \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <shishi.h>
.sp
.BI "int shishi_crc(Shishi * " handle ", const char * " in ", size_t " inlen ", char * " out[4] ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "Shishi * handle" 12
shishi handle as allocated by \fBshishi_init()\fP.
.IP "const char * in" 12
input character array of data to checksum.
.IP "size_t inlen" 12
length of input character array of data to checksum.
.IP "char * out[4]" 12
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Compute checksum of data using CRC32 modified according to RFC
1510.  The \fIout\fP buffer must be deallocated by the caller.

The modifications compared to standard CRC32 is that no initial and

LSB\-first order.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
