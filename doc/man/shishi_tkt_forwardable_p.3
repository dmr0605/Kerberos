input variable with ticket info.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Determine if ticket is forwardable.

The FORWARDABLE flag in a ticket is normally only interpreted by
the ticket\-granting service. It can be ignored by application
servers.  The FORWARDABLE flag has an interpretation similar to
that of the PROXIABLE flag, except ticket\-granting tickets may also
be issued with different network addresses. This flag is reset by
default, but users MAY request that it be set by setting the
FORWARDABLE option in the AS request when they request their
initial ticket\-granting ticket.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns non\-0 iff forwardable flag is set in ticket.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug-shishi@gnu.org>.
