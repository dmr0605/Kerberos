.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Determine if ticket may be used to grant postdated tickets.

The MAY\-POSTDATE flag in a ticket is normally only interpreted by
the ticket\-granting service. It can be ignored by application
servers.  This flag MUST be set in a ticket\-granting ticket in
order to issue a postdated ticket based on the presented ticket. It
is reset by default; it MAY be requested by a client by setting the
ALLOW\- POSTDATE option in the KRB_AS_REQ message.  This flag does
not allow a client to obtain a postdated ticket\-granting ticket;
postdated ticket\-granting tickets can only by obtained by
requesting the postdating in the KRB_AS_REQ message. The life
(endtime\-starttime) of a postdated ticket will be the remaining
life of the ticket\-granting ticket at the time of the request,
unless the RENEWABLE option is also set, in which case it can be
the full life (endtime\-starttime) of the ticket\-granting
ticket. The KDC MAY limit how far in the future a ticket may be
postdated.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns non\-0 iff may\-postdate flag is set in ticket.
