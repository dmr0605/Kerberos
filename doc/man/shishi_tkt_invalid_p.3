.SH NAME
shishi_tkt_invalid_p \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <shishi.h>
.sp
.BI "int shishi_tkt_invalid_p(Shishi_tkt * " tkt ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "Shishi_tkt * tkt" 12
input variable with ticket info.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Determine if ticket is invalid.

The INVALID flag indicates that a ticket is invalid. Application
servers MUST reject tickets which have this flag set. A postdated
ticket will be issued in this form. Invalid tickets MUST be
validated by the KDC before use, by presenting them to the KDC in a
TGS request with the VALIDATE option specified. The KDC will only
validate tickets after their starttime has passed. The validation
is required so that postdated tickets which have been stolen before
their starttime can be rendered permanently invalid (through a
hot\-list mechanism).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns non\-0 iff invalid flag is set in ticket.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug-shishi@gnu.org>.
