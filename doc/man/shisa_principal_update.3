.SH NAME
shisa_principal_update \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <shisa.h>
.sp
.BI "int shisa_principal_update(Shisa * " dbh ", const char * " realm ", const char * " principal ", const Shisa_principal * " ph ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "Shisa * dbh" 12
Shisa library handle created by \fBshisa()\fP.
.IP "const char * realm" 12
Name of realm the principal belongs in.
.IP "const char * principal" 12
Name of principal to get information on.
.IP "const Shisa_principal * ph" 12
Pointer to principal structure with information to store in database.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Modify information stored for given PRINCIPAL\fIREALM\fP.  Note that it
is usually a good idea to only set the fields in \fIph\fP that you
actually want to update.  Specifically, first calling
\fBshisa_principal_find()\fP to get the current information, then
modifying one field, and calling \fBshisa_principal_update()\fP is not
recommended in general, as this will 1) overwrite any modifications
made to other fields between the two calls (by other processes) and
2) will cause all values to be written again, which may generate
more overhead.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns SHISA_OK if successful, \fBSHISA_NO_REALM\fP if
the indicated realm does not exist, \fBSHISA_NO_PRINCIPAL\fP if the
indicated principal does not exist, or an error code.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug-shishi@gnu.org>.
