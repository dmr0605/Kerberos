KDC\-REQ variable to get kdc\-options field from.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Determine if KDC\-Option disable\-transited\-check flag is set.

By default the KDC will check the transited field of a
ticket\-granting\-ticket against the policy of the local realm before
it will issue derivative tickets based on the ticket\-granting
ticket. If this flag is set in the request, checking of the
transited field is disabled. Tickets issued without the performance
of this check will be noted by the reset (0) value of the
TRANSITED\-POLICY\-CHECKED flag, indicating to the application server
that the tranisted field must be checked locally. KDCs are
encouraged but not required to honor the DISABLE\-TRANSITED\-CHECK
option.

This flag is new since RFC 1510
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns non\-0 iff disable\-transited\-check flag is set
in KDC\-REQ.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug-shishi@gnu.org>.
