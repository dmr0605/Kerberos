.SH NAME
shishi_decrypt_iv_etype \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <shishi.h>
.sp
.BI "int shishi_decrypt_iv_etype(Shishi * " handle ", Shishi_key * " key ", int " keyusage ", int32_t " etype ", const char * " iv ", size_t " ivlen ", const char * " in ", size_t " inlen ", char ** " out ", size_t * " outlen ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "Shishi * handle" 12
shishi handle as allocated by \fBshishi_init()\fP.
.IP "Shishi_key * key" 12
key to decrypt with.
.IP "int keyusage" 12
integer specifying what this key is decrypting.
.IP "int32_t etype" 12
integer specifying what cipher to use.
.IP "const char * iv" 12
input array with initialization vector
.IP "size_t ivlen" 12
size of input array with initialization vector.
.IP "const char * in" 12
input array with data to decrypt.
.IP "size_t inlen" 12
size of input array with data to decrypt.
.IP "char ** out" 12
output array with newly allocated decrypted data.
.IP "size_t * outlen" 12
output variable with size of newly allocated output array.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Decrypts data as per encryption method using specified
initialization vector and key.  The key actually used is derived
using the key usage.  If key usage is 0, no key derivation is used.
The OUT buffer must be deallocated by the caller.  The next IV is
lost, see shishi_decrypt_ivupdate_etype if you need it.

Note that DECRYPT(ENCRYPT(data)) does not necessarily yield data
exactly.  Some encryption types add pad to make the data fit into
the block size of the encryption algorithm.  Furthermore, the pad
is not guaranteed to look in any special way, although existing
implementations often pad with the zero byte.  This means that you
may have to "frame" data, so it is possible to infer the original
length after decryption.  Compare ASN.1 DER which contains such
information.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns \fBSHISHI_OK\fP iff successful.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug-shishi@gnu.org>.
