.SH NAME
shishi_n_fold \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <shishi.h>
.sp
.BI "int shishi_n_fold(Shishi * " handle ", const char * " in ", size_t " inlen ", char * " out ", size_t " outlen ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "Shishi * handle" 12
shishi handle as allocated by \fBshishi_init()\fP.
.IP "const char * in" 12
input array with data to decrypt.
.IP "size_t inlen" 12
size of input array with data to decrypt ("M").
.IP "char * out" 12
output array with decrypted data.
.IP "size_t outlen" 12
size of output array ("N").
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Fold data into a fixed length output array, with the intent to give
each input bit approximately equal weight in determining the value
of each output bit.

The algorithm is from "A Better Key Schedule For DES\-like Ciphers"
by Uri Blumenthal and Steven M. Bellovin,
http://www.research.att.com/~smb/papers/ides.pdf, although the
sample vectors provided by the paper are incorrect.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns \fBSHISHI_OK\fP iff successful.
