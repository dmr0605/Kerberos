.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Create a Shishi library handle, using \fBshishi()\fP, and read the system
configuration file, user configuration file, and user tickets from
the specified locations.  If any of \fIusercfgfile\fP or \fIsystemcfgfile\fP
is NULL, the file is read from its default location, which for the
system configuration file is decided at compile time, and is
$sysconfdir/shishi.conf, and for the user configuration file is
$HOME/.shishi/config.  If the ticket file is NULL, a ticket file is
not read at all.

The handle is allocated regardless of return values, except for
SHISHI_HANDLE_ERROR which indicates a problem allocating the
handle.  (The other error conditions comes from reading the files.)
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns SHISHI_OK iff successful.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
