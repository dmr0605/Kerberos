.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Guesses a realm based on \fBgetdomainname()\fP (which really is NIS/YP
domain, but if it is set it might be a good guess), or if it fails,
based on \fBgethostname()\fP, or if it fails, the string
"could\-not\-guess\-default\-realm". Note that the hostname is not
trimmed off of the data returned by \fBgethostname()\fP to get the domain
name and use that as the realm.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns guessed realm for host as a string that has
to be deallocated with \fBfree()\fP by the caller.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug-shishi@gnu.org>.
