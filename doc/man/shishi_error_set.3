.SH NAME
shishi_error_set \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <shishi.h>
.sp
.BI "void shishi_error_set(Shishi * " handle ", const char * " errstr ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "Shishi * handle" 12
shishi handle as allocated by \fBshishi_init()\fP.
.IP "const char * errstr" 12
Zero terminated character array containing error description,
or NULL to clear the error description string.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Set the detailed error information string to specified string.  The
string is copied into the Shishi internal structure, so you can
deallocate the string passed to this function after the call.  This
function is mostly for Shishi internal use, but if you develop an
extension of Shishi, it may be useful to use the same error
handling infrastructure.
