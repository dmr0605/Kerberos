.SH ARGUMENTS

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Store subkey value in authenticator.  A subkey is usually created
by calling \fBshishi_key_random()\fP using the default encryption type of
the key from the ticket that is being used.  To save time, you may
want to use \fBshishi_authenticator_add_subkey()\fP instead, which calculates
the subkey and calls this function in one step.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns SHISHI_OK iff successful.
