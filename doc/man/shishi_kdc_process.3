.SH NAME
shishi_kdc_process \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <shishi.h>
.sp
.BI "int shishi_kdc_process(Shishi * " handle ", Shishi_asn1 " kdcreq ", Shishi_asn1 " kdcrep ", Shishi_key * " key ", int " keyusage ", Shishi_asn1 * " enckdcreppart ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "Shishi * handle" 12
shishi handle as allocated by \fBshishi_init()\fP.
.IP "Shishi_asn1 kdcreq" 12
input variable that holds the sent KDC\-REQ.
.IP "Shishi_asn1 kdcrep" 12
input variable that holds the received KDC\-REP.
.IP "Shishi_key * key" 12
input array with key to decrypt encrypted part of KDC\-REP with.
.IP "int keyusage" 12
kereros key usage value.
.IP "Shishi_asn1 * enckdcreppart" 12
output variable that holds new EncKDCRepPart.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Process a KDC client exchange and output decrypted EncKDCRepPart
which holds details for the new ticket received.  Use
\fBshishi_kdcrep_get_ticket()\fP to extract the ticket.  This function
verifies the various conditions that must hold if the response is
to be considered valid, specifically it compares nonces
(\fBshishi_check_nonces()\fP) and if the exchange was a AS exchange, it
also compares cname and crealm (\fBshishi_check_cname()\fP and
\fBshishi_check_crealm()\fP).

Usually the \fBshishi_as_process()\fP and \fBshishi_tgs_process()\fP functions
should be used instead, since they simplify the decryption key
computation.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns SHISHI_OK iff the KDC client exchange was
successful.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug-shishi@gnu.org>.
