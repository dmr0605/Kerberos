.SH NAME
shishi_tkts_find \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <shishi.h>
.sp
.BI "Shishi_tkt * shishi_tkts_find(Shishi_tkts * " tkts ", Shishi_tkts_hint * " hint ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "Shishi_tkts * tkts" 12
ticket set handle as allocated by \fBshishi_tkts()\fP.
.IP "Shishi_tkts_hint * hint" 12
structure with characteristics of ticket to be found.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Search the ticketset sequentially (from ticket number 0 through all
tickets in the set) for a ticket that fits the given
characteristics.  If a ticket is found, the hint\->startpos field is
updated to point to the next ticket in the set, so this function
can be called repeatedly with the same hint argument in order to
find all tickets matching a certain criterium.  Note that if
tickets are added to, or removed from, the ticketset during a query
with the same hint argument, the hint\->startpos field must be
updated appropriately.

matching tickets could be found.
