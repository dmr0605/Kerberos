.BI "void shishi_done(Shishi * " handle ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Deallocates the shishi library handle.  The handle must not be used
in any calls to shishi functions after this.

If there is a default tkts, it is written to the default tkts file
(call \fBshishi_tkts_default_file_set()\fP to change the default tkts
file). If you do not wish to write the default tkts file, close the
default tkts with shishi_tkts_done(handle, NULL) before calling
this function.
