.SH NAME
shishi_crypto \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <shishi.h>
.sp
.BI "Shishi_crypto * shishi_crypto(Shishi * " handle ", Shishi_key * " key ", int " keyusage ", int32_t " etype ", const char * " iv ", size_t " ivlen ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "Shishi * handle" 12
shishi handle as allocated by \fBshishi_init()\fP.
.IP "Shishi_key * key" 12
key to encrypt with.
.IP "int keyusage" 12
integer specifying what this key will encrypt/decrypt.
.IP "int32_t etype" 12
integer specifying what cipher to use.
.IP "const char * iv" 12
input array with initialization vector
.IP "size_t ivlen" 12
size of input array with initialization vector.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Initialize a crypto context.  This store a key, keyusage,
encryption type and initialization vector in a "context", and the
caller can then use this context to perform encryption via
\fBshishi_crypto_encrypt()\fP and decryption via \fBshishi_crypto_encrypt()\fP
without supplying all those details again.  The functions also
takes care of propagating the IV between calls.

When the application no longer need to use the context, it should
deallocate resources associated with it by calling
\fBshishi_crypto_done()\fP.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Return a newly allocated crypto context.
