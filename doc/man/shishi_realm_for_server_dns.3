.SH NAME
shishi_realm_for_server_dns \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <shishi.h>
.sp
.BI "char * shishi_realm_for_server_dns(Shishi * " handle ", char * " server ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "Shishi * handle" 12
Shishi library handle create by \fBshishi_init()\fP.
.IP "char * server" 12
hostname to find realm for.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Find realm for a host using DNS lookups, according to
draft\-ietf\-krb\-wg\-krb\-dns\-locate\-03.txt.  Since DNS lookups may be
spoofed, relying on the realm information may result in a
redirection attack.  In a single\-realm scenario, this only achieves
a denial of service, but with cross\-realm trust it may redirect you
to a compromised realm.  For this reason, Shishi prints a warning,
suggesting that the user should add the proper 'server\-realm'
configuration tokens instead.

To illustrate the DNS information used, here is an extract from a
zone file for the domain ASDF.COM:

_kerberos.asdf.com.             IN      TXT     "ASDF.COM"
_kerberos.mrkserver.asdf.com.   IN      TXT     "MARKETING.ASDF.COM"
_kerberos.salesserver.asdf.com. IN      TXT     "SALES.ASDF.COM"

Let us suppose that in this case, a client wishes to use a service
on the host foo.asdf.com.  It would first query:

_kerberos.foo.asdf.com. IN TXT

Finding no match, it would then query:

_kerberos.asdf.com. IN TXT
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns realm for host, or NULL if not found.
