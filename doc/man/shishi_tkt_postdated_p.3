input variable with ticket info.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Determine if ticket is postdated.

The POSTDATED flag indicates that a ticket has been postdated. The
application server can check the authtime field in the ticket to
see when the original authentication occurred. Some services MAY
choose to reject postdated tickets, or they may only accept them
within a certain period after the original authentication. When the
KDC issues a POSTDATED ticket, it will also be marked as INVALID,
so that the application client MUST present the ticket to the KDC
to be validated before use.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns non\-0 iff postdated flag is set in ticket.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug-shishi@gnu.org>.
