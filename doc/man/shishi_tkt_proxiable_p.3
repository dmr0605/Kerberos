.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Determine if ticket is proxiable.

The PROXIABLE flag in a ticket is normally only interpreted by the
ticket\-granting service. It can be ignored by application servers.
When set, this flag tells the ticket\-granting server that it is OK
to issue a new ticket (but not a ticket\-granting ticket) with a
different network address based on this ticket. This flag is set if
requested by the client on initial authentication. By default, the
client will request that it be set when requesting a
ticket\-granting ticket, and reset when requesting any other ticket.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns non\-0 iff proxiable flag is set in ticket.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug-shishi@gnu.org>.
