.SH NAME
shishi_decrypt_etype \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <shishi.h>
.sp
.BI "int shishi_decrypt_etype(Shishi * " handle ", Shishi_key * " key ", int " keyusage ", int32_t " etype ", const char * " in ", size_t " inlen ", char ** " out ", size_t * " outlen ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "Shishi * handle" 12
shishi handle as allocated by \fBshishi_init()\fP.
.IP "Shishi_key * key" 12
key to decrypt with.
.IP "int keyusage" 12
integer specifying what this key is decrypting.
.IP "int32_t etype" 12
integer specifying what cipher to use.
.IP "const char * in" 12
input array with data to decrypt.
.IP "size_t inlen" 12
size of input array with data to decrypt.
.IP "char ** out" 12
output array with newly allocated decrypted data.
.IP "size_t * outlen" 12
output variable with size of newly allocated output array.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Decrypts data as per encryption method using specified key.  The
key actually used is derived using the key usage.  If key usage is
0, no key derivation is used.  The OUT buffer must be deallocated
by the caller.  The default IV is used, see shishi_decrypt_iv_etype
if you need to alter it.  The next IV is lost, see
shishi_decrypt_ivupdate_etype if you need it.

Note that DECRYPT(ENCRYPT(data)) does not necessarily yield data
exactly.  Some encryption types add pad to make the data fit into
the block size of the encryption algorithm.  Furthermore, the pad
is not guaranteed to look in any special way, although existing
implementations often pad with the zero byte.  This means that you
may have to "frame" data, so it is possible to infer the original
length after decryption.  Compare ASN.1 DER which contains such
information.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns \fBSHISHI_OK\fP iff successful.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug-shishi@gnu.org>.
